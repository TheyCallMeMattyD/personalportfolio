I highly recommend using a gradient generator like https://gradientgenerator.paytonpierce.dev/ to generate a pair of colors that you like.
These colors will be used to style your name on the homepage, the background of your picture, and some other accents throughout
the site.

So let's get started! Some of the info below is pretty self-explanatory, like 'firstName' and 'bio'. I'll try to explain anything
that might not be obvious right off the bat :) I recommend looking at the template example live using "npm start" to get an idea
of what each of the values mean.

After college I joined the Navy - which led to adventures around the world as both an Air Traffic Controller and Aviator... with some experiences thrown in that I never would have imagined. Now that it's time to leave military life behind, I've decided to dive into IT - maybe even as a digital nomad around the world. It's time for the next New Adventure!",
